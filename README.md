This is the code needed to used to generate the results reported in "Climate change aggravates bird mortality in pristine tropical forests". These analyses include fitting hierarchical models assessing the effect of temperature and precipitation on apparent survival in 29 bird species at the BDFFP. Stan scripts used for fitting these models can be found in the "Stan_Scripts" folder. The "Hierarchical_BDFFP.R" file was used to prepare the capture histories, fit the models, perform model comparison, and generate some relevant statistics using the pointwise log-likelihoods. The remaining results and figures were generated in the "Results.R" script.
